Software development based on the transformation of meta-model abstractions into particular models and code artifacts is an active research line within software engineering. However, there has been less emphasis on the interoperability of the applications in charge of producing runtime instances of these models. As a consequence, model instances are tied to particular combinations of models and generation tools. If these combinations are to be changed, the data associated to the model instances is at risk of being lost.<br>
<br>
An aspect oriented approach is proposed in order to allow the synchronization of the instance repositories associated to a common meta-model, by using a model bus in charge of receiving and distributing notifications of updates made to the particular object instances. The ultimate goal of this approach is to automatically synchronize the instance data across all of the available instance repositories. Finally, in order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, an implementation based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and Spring Roo is presented.<br>
